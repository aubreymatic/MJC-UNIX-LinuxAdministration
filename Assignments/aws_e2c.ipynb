    "- Type this in the terminal \"ssh -i /path/my-key-pair-name.pem ubuntu@current-server-ip\" Note: do not type the quotes, also change the command to point to the director of your pem file and change the ip to your servers current ip.\n",

    "- Now lets install some software to make the server into a webserver for hosting your files.\n",
    "- type and enter each of the following commands\n",
    "- sudo su\n",
    "- apt-get update\n",
    "- apt-get upgrade\n",
    "- tasksel\n",

    "- When it asks you to set a password for MySQl root user, set one and don't forget it.\n",
    "- press tab to go to Ok and use enter\n",
    "- congratulations you are technically done\n",
    "- Now you have to use a UNIX based system, like linux or Mac OS, to send files using commands or on windows, use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to send files to the server. Select installation pack to get the installer .exe for WinSCP.\n",
    "- It is very similar to the way you connect with putty, and you can even import saved profiles made in putty as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What next?\n",
    "A few things:\n",
    "- Why not associate an [Elastic IP](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1346) to your instance(s)? Now you've got a static ip no matter what kind of instance you start.\n",
    "- Use your Elastic IP and set up forwarding from a domain that you own. Instead of having a random IP address\n"
